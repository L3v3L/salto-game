# Salto Game - Modern React Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive migration plan to upgrade the Salto Game from its current React 16 stack to modern React 18+ with updated dependencies and improved architecture.

## Current State Analysis

### Technology Stack (Current)
- **React**: 16.x (outdated)
- **Redux**: Legacy Redux with custom middlewares
- **Styled Components**: 4.x (outdated)
- **React Scripts**: Outdated version (needs security updates)
- **Node.js Dependencies**: Multiple outdated packages

### Architecture Assessment
- ✅ Well-structured component hierarchy
- ✅ Redux state management with Duck pattern
- ✅ Complex game logic (639-line reducer)
- ✅ Custom middleware system
- ⚠️ Using deprecated ReactDOM.render
- ⚠️ Older Redux patterns (could benefit from RTK)
- ⚠️ Security vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Migration Strategy: Incremental Upgrade

**Recommendation**: Upgrade in place rather than rewrite from scratch.

### Why Incremental Upgrade?
1. **Preserve Complex Game Logic**: Battle system, card mechanics, and effects are working
2. **Lower Risk**: Incremental changes are easier to test and debug
3. **Maintain History**: Keep git history and development context
4. **Faster Delivery**: Avoid rewriting hundreds of lines of working code

## Phase-by-Phase Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Dependency Audit & Security Updates (Priority: HIGH)

#### 1.1 Security-Critical Updates
```bash
# Update packages with known vulnerabilities
npm update lodash
npm update react-scripts
npm audit fix
```

#### 1.2 Package.json Modernization
Update [`package.json`](package.json) with current versions:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "^5.0.1",
    "styled-components": "^6.1.8",
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^2.0.1",
    "react-redux": "^9.1.0",
    "redux": "^5.0.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Remove Deprecated Dependencies
- Legacy Redux patterns → Replace with `@reduxjs/toolkit`
- Update all React 16 era dependencies

### Phase 2: React 16 → React 18 Migration (Priority: HIGH)

#### 2.1 Update React Root API
**File**: [`src/index.js`](src/index.js:14-18)

**Current**:
```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={ configureStore(initialState) }>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  rootElement,
);
```

**Updated**:
```javascript
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(rootElement);
root.render(
  <Provider store={ configureStore(initialState) }>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```

#### 2.2 StrictMode Integration
Wrap app in React.StrictMode to catch potential issues:
```javascript
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={ configureStore(initialState) }>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Phase 3: Redux Modernization (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### 3.1 Migrate to Redux Toolkit (RTK)
**File**: [`src/configureStore.js`](src/configureStore.js)

**Benefits**:
- Simplified store setup
- Built-in DevTools integration
- Immer for immutable updates
- Better TypeScript support

**Migration Strategy**:
```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import reducer from './ducks/reducer';
import {
  endTurn,
  startMonsterMoves,
  playCardActivate,
  playCardExecute,
  targetSelectionDisable,
} from './ducks/middlewares';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware()
      .concat([
        targetSelectionDisable,
        playCardActivate,
        playCardExecute,
        startMonsterMoves,
        endTurn,
      ]),
  devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
});

export default store;
```

#### 3.2 Modernize Reducer with RTK
**File**: [`src/ducks/reducer.js`](src/ducks/reducer.js)

Consider using `createSlice` for cleaner reducer logic:
```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const gameSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'game',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addEffectToMonster: (state, action) => {
      const { effect, targetMonster } = action.payload;
      const monster = state.battle.monsters.find(m => m.uuid === targetMonster.uuid);
      if (monster) {
        monster.effects.push(effect);
      }
    },
    // ... other reducers
  },
});
```

### Phase 4: Styled Components Upgrade (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### 4.1 Update Styled Components
**Files**: [`src/components/styles/`](src/components/styles/)

**Breaking Changes to Address**:
- CSS prop changes
- Theme provider updates
- TypeScript improvements

#### 4.2 Performance Optimizations
- Implement `shouldForwardProp` for better performance
- Use `css` helper for conditional styles

### Phase 5: ESLint & Code Quality (Priority: LOW)

#### 5.1 Update ESLint Configuration
**File**: [`.eslintrc.json`](.eslintrc.json)

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended",
    "plugin:import/errors",
    "plugin:import/warnings"
  ],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2023,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 6: TypeScript Migration (Priority: OPTIONAL)

#### 6.1 Gradual TypeScript Adoption
1. Rename `.js` files to `.tsx` gradually
2. Add type definitions for game state
3. Type Redux actions and reducers

#### 6.2 Game State Types
```typescript
interface GameState {
  gamesWon: number;
  isNextBattle: boolean;
  gameState: 'main' | 'battle' | 'reward' | 'lose' | 'reset';
  player: PlayerState;
  cards: CardCollection;
  monsters: MonsterCollection;
  battle: BattleState;
}
```

### Phase 7: Service Worker Update (Priority: LOW)

#### 7.1 Modern Service Worker
**File**: [`src/serviceWorker.js`](src/serviceWorker.js)

Update to use Workbox or modern service worker patterns.

## Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Regression Testing Checklist
- [ ] Game starts correctly
- [ ] Battle system functions (attack, defend, effects)
- [ ] Card playing mechanics work
- [ ] Monster AI behaves correctly
- [ ] Game state persistence
- [ ] Reward system functions
- [ ] UI rendering and interactions

### 7.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Bundle size comparison (before/after)
- [ ] Runtime performance metrics
- [ ] Memory usage analysis

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Redux State Management**: Complex reducer logic
2. **Game Logic**: Battle calculations and effects
3. **Component Interactions**: Card selection and targeting

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each phase thoroughly
2. **Feature Flags**: Use environment variables to toggle new features
3. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain git branches for easy rollback
4. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy phases separately

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Phase 1: Dependency audit and security updates
- [ ] Phase 2: React 18 migration
